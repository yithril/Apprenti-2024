Instructions:

Open the example.html file in your browser to see how the website behaves.
Carefully read the example.js file. Use the guiding questions below to understand how the code works.
Write your answers as comments directly in the example.js file under each question.

Part 1: What Are We Targeting?

What is document.getElementById, and how does it work?
(Hint: Look at how the headerTitle variable is defined. What element is it selecting?)

What does document.getElementsByClassName do?
(Hint: Check how the subtitles variable is used. Why do we need to add [0] at the end to target the first element?)

What is document.querySelector, and how is it different from getElementById or getElementsByClassName?
(Hint: Look at the revealButton variable. Why does it use #reveal-button instead of just reveal-button?)

What is document.querySelectorAll, and how is it different from querySelector?
(Hint: Look at how footerItems is used. Why do we need a loop to apply styles to all the items?)

Part 2: Using What Weâ€™ve Targeted

What is happening in this line of code?
headerTitle.style.borderBottom = '4px solid #6200ea';
(Hint: What is style.borderBottom? Is it adding or changing something?)

Why does this code use classList.toggle for the secret message?
(Hint: Look at the click event listener for revealButton. How does toggling the class make the message appear or disappear?)

What is the difference between using element.style and adding/removing classes?
(Hint: Compare how styles are applied to headerTitle versus how the hidden class is toggled on #secret-message.)

Part 3: Making the Page Interactive
What is an event listener, and how is it used here?
(Hint: Look at the addEventListener function for revealButton. What happens when the button is clicked?)

What do the mouseover and mouseout event listeners do for the footer items?
(Hint: Why does the color change when you hover over a footer item, and why does it change back when you stop hovering?)

What happens if you remove the .hidden class from the #secret-message element in the HTML file?
(Hint: Test this in your browser. Does the secret message behave differently? Why?)

Part 4: Practice Making Changes
Change the button text dynamically!
Add the following code to the click event listener for revealButton:
revealButton.textContent = "Hide Message";
What does this do, and how does it improve the button's functionality?

Experiment with styles:
Add this line of code inside the click event listener:
headerTitle.style.color = "green";
What happens to the header title when you click the button now?
