Features
Add expenses with a description, amount, and category.
Display expenses in a list.
Form validation for required fields and valid input values.
Visual feedback for invalid inputs.
Dynamic updating of expenses using JavaScript.

Future Improvements for Students
This project is a basic implementation of a budget tracker and serves as a foundation for further development. Here are some suggested improvements that students can make:

Local Storage:

Save expenses to the browser's local storage so that data persists after refreshing the page.
Load saved expenses from local storage when the app starts.
Edit and Delete Expenses:

Add the ability to edit or delete individual expenses from the list.
Update the display and local storage accordingly.
Running Totals:

Implement a running total that sums all the expenses and shows the user how much theyâ€™ve spent.
Optionally, break down expenses by category and display the total per category.
Expense Filtering:

Add filtering options to show expenses by category or within a certain date range.
Graphical Representation:

Use a charting library (like Chart.js) to display expenses in a pie chart or bar chart format.
Show a visual breakdown of expenses by category.
Mobile Responsiveness:

Make the layout fully responsive for mobile and tablet devices.
Dark Mode:

Add a toggle for dark mode to improve user experience.
